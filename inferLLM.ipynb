      "1. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light.\n",
      "2. The shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, are scattered more effectively by these small molecules than the longer wavelengths, like red and orange.\n",
      "3. As a result, the blue and violet light is dispersed throughout the atmosphere, reaching our eyes from all directions.\n",
      "4. Our brains process this scattered blue light as the color of the sky, giving it its characteristic blue hue.\n",
      "\n",
      "This effect is more pronounced during the daytime when the sun is overhead, and the amount of scattering particles in the atmosphere is greater. The blue color can be intensified by the presence of aerosols like dust, pollution, or water vapor, which can scatter even more light in the shorter wavelengths.\n",
      "\n",
      "At sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on hues of red, orange, and pink because the sun's rays have to travel longer distances through the atmosphere, scattering off more particles and molecules along the way. This reduces the amount of blue light that reaches our eyes, making the sky appear warmer.\n",
